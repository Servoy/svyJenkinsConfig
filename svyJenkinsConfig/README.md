Documentation
-------------
See the [Wiki](https://wiki.servoy.com/display/DOCS/Using+Istanbul+to+integrate+code+coverage+report+in+Jenkins) for the available documentation

To enable code coverage with Istanbul the test solutions must save the coverage result into the coverage.json file during the onSolutionClose of the test solution.
See sample code in the [svyUtils feature/jenkins](https://github.com/Servoy/svyUtils/blob/feature/jenkins/svyUtils_test/svyUtils_test.js)
